# MHAGuideNet: A 3D Pre-trained Guidance Model for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using 2D Multi-Planar sMRI Images

## Project Overview
This project is created based on the effective network to diagnose the AD within structural magnetic resonance (sMRI) data. It currently includes the main algorithm modules related to the paper, along with the desensitized datasets provided in this repository. To reproduce the results of the paper, adjusting certain network structure parameters according to the specific dataset is all that's needed.

## Reproducing Paper Results
If you wish to reproduce the results of the paper, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local environment:
  ``https://github.com/NieyYuanbi/MHAGuideNet``
- Adjust network structure parameters: Depending on your dataset, you may need to modify the code's network structure parameters to fit your data.
- Run the `train.py`.
